Most Impactful Improvements Based on Your Current Code
Given your existing implementation, the most feasible and impactful improvements to apply are:

1. Improve Capacity in Rayleigh Fading Scenarios (Pedestrian, Random)
âœ… Hybrid TDL + Rayleigh Model:

Modify the generate_channel() function to combine TDL and Rayleigh fading for Pedestrian and Random tasks.
Example: Instead of using only Rayleigh, mix a low-complexity TDL model with Rayleigh fading for better generalization.
âœ… Adaptive Noise Power:

Instead of fixing NOISE_POWER = 0.1, dynamically adjust it based on task difficulty.
Higher noise for complex channels (e.g., Random) and lower noise for structured channels.
2. Optimize EWC Hyperparameters Dynamically
âœ… Adaptive Lambda (Î») Per Task Complexity:

Instead of a fixed LAMBDA_EWC = 10000, adjust it based on:
High Î» for Static, Vehicular, Aerial (to retain previous knowledge).
Lower Î» for Pedestrian, Random (to allow more flexible learning).
Modify ewc_loss() to adjust Î» dynamically based on the task.
âœ… Gradient-Based Fisher Information Scaling:

Modify compute_fisher() to scale Fisher Information based on gradient magnitude, improving task retention.
3. Reduce Computational Overhead and Improve Energy Efficiency
âœ… Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):

Convert model weights to FP16 precision to reduce GPU memory overhead.
Modify model layers to dtype=tf.float16.
âœ… Neural Network Pruning:

Remove unnecessary neurons after training with tf.keras.Model.prune().
Test if removing the second hidden layer reduces complexity while maintaining performance.
âœ… Batch Size Optimization:

Dynamically adjust batch size based on GPU memory usage and channel conditions.
Example: Larger batch sizes for stable tasks (Static, Vehicular) and smaller batch sizes for Rayleigh fading tasks.
4. Compare Against Baselines for Validation
âœ… Add a Non-Continual Learning Baseline:

Train a separate model for each task and compare it with EWC to show the benefits of continual learning.
Store results for both models and compare forgetting, latency, and capacity.
âœ… Include Traditional Beamforming (MMSE or Zero-Forcing):

Modify the loss function (ewc_loss()) to compare against:
MMSE beamforming weights as a baseline.
Zero-Forcing (ZF) beamforming for high-SNR tasks.
5. Visual Improvements for Better Interpretability
âœ… Capacity & Forgetting Heatmap:

Instead of only plotting task performance, visualize forgetting over time using a heatmap.
âœ… Visualize Beamforming Vectors per Task:

Save beam pattern visualizations before and after training for each task.
Compare how EWC affects beam direction changes.
Next Steps
ðŸš€ I recommend implementing Hybrid TDL + Rayleigh, Adaptive Î», and QAT (FP16 precision) first.
Would you like me to modify your code to include these changes? ðŸš€
